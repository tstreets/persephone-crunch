### Live Link

### Key Takeaways

Show understanding of web development techniques, such as:

- html
- css
- js

### Core Webpages

**Home Page**

Home page will be a sky and a body of water that takes over the entire page. The water will stretch down the page or "go deeper", allowing the user to scroll down. This water will be split up by 3 sections ranging from a light, medium, and dark blue, showing the pond, lake, and ocean creatures. There will be a label for each section that can be clicked on.

**Pond, Lake, and Ocean Pages**

Clicking on the labels on the home page will lead to these pages. These will include names and images that can be clicked on. When clicked, either a pop-up or a new page will be displayed, showing info on said creature

**Creatures Page**

Will display info such as location, name, images, story, etc.
